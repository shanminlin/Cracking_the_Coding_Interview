# Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions with Detailed Walkthrough

## Introduction
While being able to come out with a solution is important, it is critical to communicate your thinking process.
Though the book 'Cracking the Coding Interview' provides solutions and explainations, there is still a lack of detailed workflow for Python users. Therefore, I created this repository using coding questions in the book (6th edition).

## What are included in the solution
- The steps for problem solving
- Clarification questions you can ask
- Edge cases
- The rationale in choosing a particular data structure: the alternatives and their pros and cons for the current problem.
- Time and space complexity analysis with explanation 
- Alternative solutions are included because it is important to think about alternatives and how to improve the solution, leading to more efficient ones
- Testing to make sure the code is correct
